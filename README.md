# Life-satisfaction
We study predictors of life satisfaction in Russia and other transition economies using econometric analysis, economic theory and insights from sociology and psychology. In particular, in our recent article (joint with Igor Fedotenkov) published in JCR [Bryukhanov, Fedotenkov, 2021]. More specifically, Using data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE) and different econometric models, we document positive associations between religiosity and life satisfaction. In particular, fixed effect and instrumental variable regressions provide evidence for a positive effect of religiosity.
Below I show insights from Russian RLMS survey, representing estimated probabilities (95% confidence intervals are computed using DELTA Method) of being satisfied.

Regressions include schooling, urban residence and health controls, primary sampling units fixed effects and year dummies (1998-2019).
