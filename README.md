This file contains very rough estimates of educational marginal effect  (approximated by logistic regressions) throughout the World (based on a data excerpt from 
the World Values Survey). I control for "age" and "age squared" terms only.A binary variable "hedu" =1 , if an individual has a unversity degree. Note that this exercise has no way of dealing with causality,  omitted variable bias or measurement error. If you are willing to go deeper, please, 
consult a standard econometrics textbook [e.g. Wooldridge (2002)].
